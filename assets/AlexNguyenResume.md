## EXPERIENCE

**Software Development Engineer, Amazon EconTech**. March 2020 – Present  
(Python, Bash, TypeScript, Java)

- Multidisciplinary team of Software Engineers, Data Scientists, and Economists. Built machine learning
  systems for scale.
- Designed and implemented an inference pipeline processing billions of data points. Collaborated with
  Scientists to put their experiments into production systems.
- Maintained an API service that served cost predictions. Worked with Engineers on other teams to get
  requirements and Service-level agreements (SLA).

**Software Development Engineer, AWS Thinkbox**. June 2019 – March 2020  
(Python, Bash, PowerShell, C#)

- Team’s focus was on [Deadline](https://www.awsthinkbox.com/deadline), a render farm management tool customers can use for their cloud, on-premise, or hybrid farms.
- Added Amazon DocumentDB support to Deadline. Upgraded dependencies, refactored database layer,
  and added new unit & integration tests.
- Helped maintain a [Conda build farm](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/user-guide/tutorials/build-pkgs.html)
  for packages, tools, & products. For example, a simple task would be updating Numpy’s version. An
  involved task would be adding [openssh-portable](https://github.com/PowerShell/openssh-portable)
  to our repository.
